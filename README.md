# Smart-counting-system-for-parking-area
In this problem, me and my teamate propose a simple circuit for counting available and taken slots in a praking area automatically and display them to LCD mornitor to inform customer.
Specially, for both enter and exit gates, they can work simultaneously without overlap or error

## Hardware required
- Arduino or Genuino Board 	        (x1)
- Servo SG90  	                    (x2)
- LCD1602	                          (x2)
- Potentiometer 	                  (x1)
- Ultrasonic distance sensors 	    (x2)
- 220 ohm resistors	
- Hook-up wires
- Breadboard

## Details
We have attached the documentation about this project in [Smart parking.pdf](https://github.com/DarkMatter1970s/Smart-counting-system-for-parking-area/blob/main/Smart%20parking.pdf) which includes everything from design to implementation this idea.
For source code, go to [src/SmartCounting.ino](https://github.com/DarkMatter1970s/Smart-counting-system-for-parking-area/blob/main/src/SmartCounting.ino), written in C++
